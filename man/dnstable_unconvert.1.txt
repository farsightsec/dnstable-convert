== SYNOPSIS ==

^dnstable_unconvert^ [-z] 'DB-FILE' 'NMSG-FILE'

except if 'NMSG-FILE' has the value '-' then 'stdout' will be written to.

If the ^-z^ option is given, ^dnstable_unconvert^ will write compressed data
to 'NMSG-FILE'.

It will exit with ^1^ if the unconversion failed during setup.

It will exit with ^2^ if the unconversion failed while writing the output.
