== NAME ==

dnstable_convert - convert passive DNS NMSG data to dnstable MTBL format

== SYNOPSIS ==

^dnstable_convert^ [^-D^] [^-c TYPE^] [^-l LEVEL^] [^-m #^] 'NMSG-FILE' 'DB-DNS-FILE' 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE'

== DESCRIPTION ==

Converts passive DNS data from NMSG format to MTBL format.  The input
NMSG data in 'NMSG-FILE' must be encoded using the SIE/dnsdedupe
message schema, and the output data will be written to two separate
MTBL files: the 'DB-DNS-FILE' containing "plain" DNS records, and the
'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', containing DNSSEC-related records.

If 'NMSG-FILE' has the value '-' then 'stdin' will be read from.

Specifically, all resource records of type DS, RRSIG, NSEC, DNSKEY,
NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, DLV, CDS, CDNSKEY, and TA are stored in the
'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', and resource records of all other types are stored
in the 'DB-DNS-FILE'.  If the ^-D^ flag is provided then CDS, CDNSKEY,
and TA will also be stored in the 'DB-DNS-FILE' file for transition
compability.

^dnstable_convert^ will create both the 'DB-DNS-FILE' and
'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', and will abort if either exists. If the input file
contains no DNS-related records, 'DB-DNS-FILE' will be removed. Conversely,
if the input file contains no DNSSEC-related records, 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE'
will be removed.

The output files produced by ^dnstable_convert^ are suitable for use with other
dnstable tools like ^dnstable_dump^(1) and ^dnstable_merge^(1), or with the
^dnstable_reader^(3) API. Since they are in MTBL format, they can also be read
with the ^mtbl_reader^(3) API.

By default, ^dnstable_convert^ will use ^/var/tmp/^ to store temporary
mtbl files.  The optional 'VARTMPDIR' environment variable can
be set to override the location.  Specifying a filesystem for RAM-based
storage or specifying the same filesystem as the source data file might
be useful.

== OPTIONS ==

^-D^::
    This flag enables a transitional compatibility mode described above.

^-c TYPE^::
    Use TYPE compression (Default: zlib).

^-l LEVEL^::
    Use numeric LEVEL of compression. Default varies based on TYPE.

^-m #^::
    This flag takes a positive integer value.  Specifies the maximum
    amount of memory to use for in-memory sorting, in megabytes.
    Defaults to 2048 megabytes (e.g. 2 gigabytes).  See the
    ^mtbl_sorter^(3) API.
