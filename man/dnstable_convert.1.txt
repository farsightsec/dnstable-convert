== NAME ==

dnstable_convert - convert passive DNS NMSG data to dnstable MTBL format

== SYNOPSIS ==

^dnstable_convert^ [^-D^] 'NMSG-FILE' 'DB-FILE' 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE'

== DESCRIPTION ==

Converts passive DNS data from NMSG format to MTBL format.  The input NMSG data
in 'NMSG-FILE' must be encoded using the SIE/dnsdedupe message schema, and the
output data will be written to two separate MTBL files: the 'DB-FILE' containing
"plain" DNS records, and the 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', containing DNSSEC-related
records. (Specifically, all resource records of type DS, RRSIG, NSEC, DNSKEY,
NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, and DLV are stored in the 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', and resource
records of all other types are stored in the 'DB-FILE'.)

^dnstable_convert^ will create both the 'DB-FILE' and 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE', and
will abort if either exists. If the input file contains no DNSSEC-related
records, 'DB-DNSSEC-FILE' will be removed.

The output files produced by ^dnstable_convert^ are suitable for use with other
dnstable tools like ^dnstable_dump^(1) and ^dnstable_merge^(1), or with the
^dnstable_reader^(3) API. Since they are in MTBL format, they can also be read
with the ^mtbl_reader^(3) API.

By default, ^dnstable_convert^ will use ^/var/tmp/^ to store temporary
mtbl files.  The optional 'VARTMPDIR' environment variable can
be set to override the location.  Specifying a filesystem for RAM-based
storage or specifying the same filesystem as the source data file might
be useful.

== OPTIONS ==

^-D^::
    This flag enables a transitional compatibility mode for migrating
    selected DNSSEC types from being in just the ^dns.^ files to also
    being in the ^dnssec.^ files.
