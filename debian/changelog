dnstable-convert (0.11.0-1) debian-fsi; urgency=medium

  * Add new tool dnstable_unconvert which converts the RRSET entries
    of a dnstable file to the equivalent NMSG format.

  * Add SVCB and HTTPS records indexing support, based upon
    draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-07. Note that the hostname portion in
    the RDATA is downcased in the sliced encoding and reversed name entry.

  * Put CDS, CDNSKEY, and TA resource record types into dnssec.*
    output files.  To duplicate these three DNSSEC types to the dns.*
    output files for compatibility, use the new dnstable_convert -D
    option.

  * Put RRtype in the currently empty value portion of RRSET_NAME_FWD
    and RDATA_NAME_REV indexes if it's in range (1 to 65535). Use
    an 8-bit integer if it is less than 256, else uses a 16-bit little
    endian integer.

  * Generate ENTRY_TYPE_TIME_RANGE and ENTRY_TYPE_VERSION metadata
    entries in output dnstable files.

  * The versions of the following entries are:
    ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET = 0
    // Initial version.

    ENTRY_TYPE_RRSET_NAME_FWD = 1
    // Add rrtype union as value.

    ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA = 1
    // Fix the SRV slicing and add SVCB/HTTPS sliced entries.

    ENTRY_TYPE_RDATA_NAME_REV = 1
    // Add SOA, SVCB, and HTTPS name indexing; add rrtype union as value.

  * dnstable_convert: use input file - (dash) for standard input (stdin).

  * dnstable_convert: add -c compression option to set type of
    compression used. This defaults to zlib.

  * dnstable_convert: add -l compression option to set compression
    level.

  * dnstable_convert: add -m option to specify maximum megabytes of
    memory to use for in-memory sorting. It defaults to
    2048 MB.

  * Various changes to the status output from dnstable_convert when
    it runs.

  * Documentation and testing improvements.
